# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore visible colors to all buttons and box components that are currently rendering without background or border colors.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix button elements to display with proper background colors and hover states using the OKLCH color system
- Restore background and border colors to all card and box components (product cards, diet plan cards, recommendation sections, form containers)
- Ensure CSS custom properties from index.css are correctly applied throughout all components

**User-visible outcome:** All buttons and boxes throughout the application will display with visible colors and proper styling, making the interface functional and visually complete.
